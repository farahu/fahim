  Met Fahim for the first time today. Zeshan introduced him as the "master of CS." Mildly intimidated.

  Continously pestering Fahim with questions about start-up. He always takes the time to answer.

  Fahim took the time to bike back home with me today, even though he lives on the complete other side of campus. No one's done that before.

  I didn't have the best day today, and I spent some time hiding in the corner of the prayer room crying. Fahim noticed me somehow, and offered me a piece of candy. He really is the nicest person.
