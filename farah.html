 I remember meeting Fahim for the first time fall quarter. Zeshan introduced him as the "master of CS." Was mildly intimidated.

  No matter how many questions I throw at Fahim, he never seems too tired to answer them.

  Fahim took the time to bike back home with me, even though he lives on the complete other side of campus. No one's done that before.

  A lot of craziness happened. I was scared I'd lose the friends I had just gotten close with from the beginning of the year. But Fahim stuck around, and never changed the way he was with me. I'm glad our friendship is more than circumstantial.

  One time I was having a particularly bad day, and I spent some time hiding in the corner of the prayer room crying. Fahim noticed me somehow, and offered me a piece of candy. He really is the nicest person.

  I wasn't having the best week, and I guess it showed on my face. Fahim reached out to me and asked if I was doing alright. I'm glad he's there to listen.

  I'm so glad I decided to take 227b with Fahim, I remember when he first texted me about the class. He's done more than any normal group member, and has truly been like a mentor for me this quarter. Though sometimes Fahim likes his screen resolution too high and the text is hard to read, he always adjusts it when I point it out. :P Thanks Fahim.
