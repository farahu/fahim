  Fahim would take the time to play my game at the end of CS106A last quarter and would do it until he had completely memorized all the moves XD. Honestly can't be more grateful!

  I remember how Fahim helped with downloading the slideshow for MSU. I don't know what he did but he managed to connect his computer to his computer in his house. I have no clue, but he did it!

 Before we played basketball, I had left my bike near the library. I said that I would go there from OU and then bike to branner. I told him he could go directly, but he insisted on biking with me to the library.

  I swear this still resonates with me from Fahim's spotlight: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
