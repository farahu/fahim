  In winter break…he came to Houston. Always insisted on paying for everything when we went out. Unacceptable, but wallahi that’s another level of a friend.

  2 weeks ago: I stayed up the night to finish another PSET. Then met him to work on VR. I literally could not function. I said I was going to take a 5 min nap. Woke up 30 min later and he had completed the programming himself and typed up the whole write-up.

  If you really want something then he’ll never say no. Never. One time he spent the extra hour to go to Trader Joe’s with me even though he needed nothing from Trader Joe’s.

  But it’s really the smaller things that count. Knowing that I can always ask for help, and even if he gets 2 hours of sleep, he’ll help. Also when working on group stuff, I know he can code up the things faster than me, but he lets me drive (with a little mocking but that I can live with haha). Usually people get annoyed. He never gets annoyed no matter how many questions I ask or how slow I’m going.

  Something that he does not even related to me, but really affects me: Calling and talking to his parents twice everyday, on the dot at the same times. That really emphasizes how caring he is. Makes me want to talk to my family more.
